                <p className="terms-heading">8. Vendors</p>
                <p className="terms-description">
                    Each Vendor accepts that they are merely listed on the TGIS platform, through which
                    they get reach to their target customer. Each Vendor creates their profile on the TGIS
                    platform and ensures to provide correct information regarding such profiles. Any
                    misrepresentation of their identity or work shall be their liability alone and not the liability
                    of TGIS.
                    <br/>
                    Vendors accept and acknowledge that they are entering into transactions and providing
                    services to the Customer independently and are TGIS is in no way involved, apart from
                    being a listing platform. TGIS, however expects Vendors to maintain quality of service
                    and make no misrepresentations whatsoever.
                    <br/>
                    Vendors shall not use any third party photographs or content and represent them as
                    being their own. Any such misrepresentation shall be the liability of the Vendor alone.
                    As a wedding aggregator, TGIS has commercial dealings with certain vendors on its
                    platform. This commercial arrangement, includes but is not restricted to, providing
                    additional visibility in return for a certain fee
                    <br/>
                    This fee doesn’t in any way guarantee any business confirmations/ bookings. TGIS acts
                    as a facilitator , helping vendors leverage its vast network and enabling them to reach out
                    to more customers
                    <p className="terms-heading">Reviews on Vendor profiles:</p>
                    Reviews written for vendors on their TGIS profile are a very important tool for customers
                    as well as vendors. We therefore take utmost care to uphold the integrity & credibility of
                    reviews on our platform
                    <br/>
                    You can report a review as being false to TGIS for
                    <br/>
                    Verification <a href = "mailto: info@thegreatindianshaadi.com">info@thegreatindianshaadi.com</a>
                    <br/>
                    TGIS team will contact the Vendor within 48 hours and ask to submit them
                    aforementioned proof for the review. The verification case will be closed if the vendor
                    fails to submit the proof within 7 days after being contacted.
                    a) If TGIS receives appropriate and satisfactory proof - The review will be removed from
                    the vendor profile within 1 week, after notification to the vendor & the reviewer.
                    Note that TGIS cannot & does not verify and confirm to every statement written in the
                    reviews on vendor profiles. However, we maintain a fair verification process of the
                    reviews once reported to ensure that reviews on TGIS are posted by genuine clients of
                    vendors and that they follow our terms.
                    <br/>
                    TGIS reserves the right to disable a review of the reviewer who has been proven to not
                    hire the vendor through involvement of TGIS, for any reason. TGIS has the sole
                    discretion to decide whether reported reviews are to be further investigated or not.
                    TGIS prides itself in ensuring authentic and genuine reviews that can help engaged
                    couples make better hiring decisions. As a platform committed to showcasing honest
                    reviews, we request our vendors to abide by the following guidelines.
                    The Vendor can ask their clients to review their Profile on TGIS and share their profile
                    link with them & ask them to write a review, or, could simply ask them to share their
                    review & rating with us on <a href = "mailto: info@thegreatindianshaadi.com">info@thegreatindianshaadi.com</a> & we will get the review
                    uploaded on their behalf.
                    <br/>
                    The best way to get positive reviews is by delighting your clients. Selective solicitation is
                    a strict NO. Offering any type of compensation, getting your family/relatives/team
                    members to write a review for you is completely unacceptable & such reviews would be
                    removed without any intimation
                    Whether you agree with the feedback or not, we recommend you take the criticism in
                    good stride. In cases of a negative review, we strongly suggest you reply to the review
                    with your side of the story as it shows that you care. From our statistics, we have seen
                    that users read both sides of the story and take an impartial call while reading reviews.
                    Moreover, some of the most popular and booked vendors on TGIS have also received
                    negative reviews on their profiles so you don't need to worry. Also, another way to
                    mitigate the impact would be to get more positive reviews on your profile so that the
                    negative review is pushed down & your average rating is improved.
                    <p className="terms-heading">Deletion of Profile of Vendor:</p>
                    TGIS does not permit or facilitate account deletions of Vendors, once made. The account
                    may be marked as unclaimed and be made unsearchable upon the platform’s discretion
                    Vendor’s request.
                    <br/>
                    Please note, a vendor’s profile may be created even without their prior consent. One
                    such method of this is creating a profile with the users submitting reviews of vendors who
                    don’t have an active, listed profile on TGIS yet
                    <br/>
                    As a trustworthy aggregator of wedding info and data, TGIS showcases this info;
                    However in an unclaimed/ unverified state due to absence of complete details.

                <br/>

                vendors’ inputs and those of their customers. While TGIS does take efforts to verify the
                claims made in the form of price, work etc, it in no way ensures/ guarantees the
